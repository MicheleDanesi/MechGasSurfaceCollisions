# MechGasSurfaceCollisions

This program simulates the collisions between particles and a rough pyramid-like surface. It can be set the number of particles, the dimension of the particles with respect to the pyramid side dimension and the starting velocity of the surface. I cannot explain in details the goal of the program since it is part of an ongoing research.
